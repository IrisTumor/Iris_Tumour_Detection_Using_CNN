**Iris Tumor Detection Using CNN**
It is a deep learning project aimed at detecting iris tumors by classifying iris images into two categories: Healthy and Tumor. The model leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image analysis, trained on a labeled dataset. It involves preprocessing the images, training the model, and evaluating it using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. The project aims to provide an efficient and automated solution for early tumor detection. Future enhancements include using larger datasets and advanced architectures for improved accuracy.

The collected data is segregated into two categories: images with tumor and without tumor:https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hoNmB1YMZTg5fHQyWwe7zmcEfHXtha7R?usp=sharing
